# ComicVineWrapper

A simple API wrapper to satisfy the needs of https://github.com/112madgamer/ComicSorter 

Also most of the Axios stuff is from https://github.com/DasWolke/SnowTransfer check it out DasWolke is a cool person.

I know that this is most likely built wrong. But it works for my use, if you really want it to be nice fork it.
